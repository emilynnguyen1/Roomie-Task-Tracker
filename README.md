# Roomie Task Tracker

## Project Overview
**Roomie Task Tracker** is an object-oriented programming project in Java that incorporates the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), UML/Use Case Diagrams, Class Diagrams, and Activity Diagrams.

This application is designed to address communication issues that often arise among roommates, particularly those in shared living spaces like college dorm rooms or apartments. The system provides features to help roommates manage shared chores and responsibilities effectively, improving communication, accountability, and contributing to a peaceful living environment.

## Target Audience
This application is aimed at college students or any individuals living with roommates. It’s particularly useful for those who have had difficulty coordinating shared responsibilities in a household or dorm setting.

## Key Features
- **User Authentication**: New users can register with a first name, last name, username, and password. Existing users can log in using their credentials.
- **Roommate Group Creation**: Users can either create a new group or join an existing one.
- **Chore Assignment**: Users can add chores, view the available chores list, assign themselves tasks, and mark chores as completed.
- **No GUI**: This project is designed to be run from the terminal.

## How to Use This Project
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE.
3. Run the program from the `App.java` class.

Upon running the program, users will be prompted with the following:
1. **Login or Create New User**: First-time users can create an account, while returning users can log in.
2. **Group Creation or Joining**: New users can create a roommate group or join an existing one from the list of available groups.
3. **Chore Management**: The menu allows users to list available chores, add new chores, view their assigned chores, or mark chores as completed.
4. **Exit**: Users can exit the application at any time, which will terminate the program.

### Note
You can find some initialized users, their passwords, and roommate groups at the top of the `ChoreManagementSystem.java` file.

## Project Milestones
1. **Milestone #1 – Select Topic**:
   - Selected a topic of manageable scope: roommate communication and chore tracking.
2. **Milestone #2 – Requirements Document and Use Case Diagrams**:
   - Described the system rationale, target users, functional and nonfunctional requirements.
   - Created a Use Case Diagram showing system actors and use cases.
3. **Milestone #3 – Class Diagrams**:
   - Created a Class Diagram to represent relationships between system classes.
   - Provided a detailed description of class relationships.
4. **Milestone #4 – Activity Diagrams**:
   - Created an Activity Diagram detailing user actions, actors involved, and sequence of activities.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: Object-oriented programming language used to implement the system.
- **SDLC**: Applied Software Development Life Cycle methodology.
- **UML**: Unified Modeling Language diagrams for system design.
